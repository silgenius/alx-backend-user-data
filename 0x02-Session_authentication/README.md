# 0x02. Session Authentication

## Overview

This repository contains a project focused on **Session Authentication**. The goal is to implement secure and efficient session management for a web application. Session authentication is a technique used to maintain a user's state between HTTP requests by using a session ID, stored on the client-side (usually as a cookie), and validated on the server-side.

In this project, you will learn to:

- Create a session ID and store it in cookies.
- Implement server-side session storage.
- Use secure HTTP headers to protect user sessions.
- Handle authentication and session expiration.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask (for server-side logic)
- `Flask-Session` (for session management)
- `Flask-SQLAlchemy` (optional, for persistent session storage)
